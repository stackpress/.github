## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The roadmap for web tech is in limbo, riddled with over-bloated, 
semi-open source, toolings of toolings, enterprise cloud service traps, 
and all encompassing front-end first and last libraries that are always 
in canary experimenting with other people's live apps and the developers 
that use them causing regular app rewrites. Things like MVC, design 
patterns, separation of responsibilities, abstraction, resuability, code 
once deploy everywhere are non-existent. We choose stacks purely based 
on popularity, and always and code the same sign-in form page from the 
ground up for lack of a better option. The learning curve for web 
development has gone full `pill`. It takes 4 times longer to do anything 
because there a lot of ops. It started with just server ops, then added 
dev ops, now it's ops of ops that manage tools of tools. There are so much
tools of tools that there are now automation of tools, which in fact is 
another tool in itself. And 22 years later, we still get auto-scaling 
on AWS wrong. Cloud services are built on top of other cloud services
or combine two or more services together in order to charge more 
for the use of that service. Then services are created on top of these 
cloud service derrivatives by 3rd parties charge even more. These 
services do provide "open source" libraries that work with their service
but, requires a download of private code in order to use them. They built
their libraries using other open source projects, but noone can build on 
top of their libraries because it's built around a lot of secrets. Web 
development is exponentially harder today and bares the huge risk of 
learning time and death months later. A library designed to temporarily 
shim web components in 2013 beat native web components today due to 
better marketing overtime. Then that same library that invented front-end 
first, and destroyed a generation from learning MVC and good design 
patterns decide to force their community to write components on the 
server and claim it's stable, but you still can't do a simple server 
redirect to a dynamic URL after a form submission. With this new 
direction of putting components on the server, a framework built on top 
of this library decides to add another highly opinionated routing system 
into the core instead of just creating another framework to save 
marketing costs, and now causes a simple `hello world` to require 
200 MB of packages minimum and takes no responsibility on the surcharges 
that get billed when a serverless function exceeds the free tier. It 
all went downhill when Oracle changed the MySQL license.
